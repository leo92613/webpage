# **[MRL/VR] -> [FRL] next meeting**
# *MONDAY - Sept.12th 6-8pm*

It's a new semester and a good time to make some changes. For one thing - instead of [MRL/VR] (media research lab / vr group) we will be known as [FRL] (future reality lab). In addition, due to popular demand, we are moving our meetings from Wednesdays to Mondays.

In order for everyone to get their sea legs with this new time and date we'll be kicking it off with an open mic. We'd love to hear about you and your interest in VR and what you'd like to get out of our meetups. In addition if there's anything particularly fascinating in terms of apps or companies or techniques that you think everyone should know about this will be a perfect opportunity to share.
